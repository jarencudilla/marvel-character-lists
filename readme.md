Though I managed to get a list of characters, I'm still not happy with it. 
But it's a small victory for me since I know that I can do it.

Couple of things to ponder:

- [X] 1. I need my apikey to stored somewhere else. as I've researched it can be on the .env file
- [] 2. I need my api calls to be dynamic and not just a static show all characters.
         it should be :  
         - [] * by character name   
         - [] * by powers   
         - [] * by teams   
         - [] * by classification  
- [] 3. I need to make a search feature that would accept all those variables I mentioned above.
