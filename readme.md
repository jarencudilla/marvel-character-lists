Though I managed to get a list of characters, I'm still not happy with it. 
But it's a small victory for me since I know that I can do it.

Couple of things to ponder:

1. I need my apikey to stored somewhere else. as I've researched it can be on the .env file
2. I need my api calls to be dynamic and not just a static show all characters.
   2a. it should be 
   1 by character name 
   2 by powers 
   3 by teams 
   4 by classification
3. I need to make a search feature that would accept all those variables I mentioned above.
